Project Deliverable 2

Requirements

Phase 2 Deliverable must contain the goal of this phase of the project, and a logical design of
the database (resulting from the mapping of an EER schema to a Relational schema). It must
describe any revisions made to the specification described in the Phase 1 Deliverable. It must
further describe the problems encountered in Phase 2 and justify the solutions.
For Phases 2 and 3, you will not be responsible for designing/implementing code for functions
that are outside of the domain of the HealthTrack Personal Wellness Platform. For instance,
the following area constitutes a function which is not part of the front-end system: Health
data analytics for insurance companies.

------

## What is expected:
1. Outline the goals for this phase and briefly mention any revisions made to the previous
phase. If you have modified your EER diagram, turn in the modified copy.
2. EER to Relational mapping:
- Illustrate how you translated from the EER diagram to your relational schema. It should follow the EER to relational mapping algorithm.
- Primary keys and foreign keys should be correctly identified on the relational database schema.
- Show (in words) any other candidate keys.
- Show constraints (in words) over and above referential integrity constraints for each table (if you have any).
3. Identify any difficulties you may have had with this phase of the project.
