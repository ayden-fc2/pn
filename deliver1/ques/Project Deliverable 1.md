Project Deliverable 1

Requirements
Deliverable 1 must contain an analysis of the intended database system and a conceptual schema. It must describe the problems encountered in this phase and justify the solutions.

What is expected:
1.Outline the goals of this phase of the project.
2.Analyze the entire application for the HealthTrack Personal Wellness Platform and create an extended ER diagram.
oUse the notation for E/R model constructs and the additional notation for specialization/generalization hierarchies learned in class.
oShow entity types, relationship types (including class/subclass relationships), and attributes.
oShow different types of attributes (e.g., simple/composite, single-valued/multi-valued, stored/derived) if needed.
oShow roles on any recursive relationship types.
oShow key attributes for each entity type (only one key should be shown on the diagram).
oInclude structural constraints (cardinality ratio and participation constraints). Use both the traditional notation and the (min, max) notation for the constraints as an exercise.
oUse a diagram editor to draw a clean and readable diagram.
3.Mention any assumptions you made that go beyond what is given in the project description. In particular, mention all assumptions that led you to determine the structural constraints.
4.List any constraints that apply to the data over and above what you can show in the ER diagram. Specifically, make a list of any additional keys for entity types.
5.Besides the above, comment on the difficulties you faced in completing this conceptual design task.

Please note that the specifications also describe different actions (e.g., user registrations, booking appointments, creating wellness challenges, etc.). These are part of the functional requirements. These actions cannot be represented in the schemas you are going to design. You should only make sure that your schemas have the components necessary for recording the information that is needed to allow these actions to take place.
Note also that this specification will drive your subsequent phases. As in any actual design and implementation, you will likely revise what you do here as you proceed through the project.
