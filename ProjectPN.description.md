PROJECT
Purpose of this project
Analyze, design, implement, and document a database system application. You will use the methodology for database development learned in class. The system must be implemented on a DBMS with any language as a host-language for the application. The system can be implemented as a desktop, web, or mobile application and must have a Graphical User Interface that includes the basic functionality described below.

The HealthTrack Personal Wellness Platform
The following specifications are intended as a guide. These are intended to be a basis for you to get started in the right direction in designing your system. You as the designer must analyze and decide what other details or features should be specified for your system if they are necessary. Thus, individual group implementations will differ in terms of design and implementation styles. Every group has to mention clearly in its report what other specifications are assumed.
Data and Functional Requirements
HealthTrack is a personal health and wellness management platform, similar to apps like MyChart or Fitbit, that enables individuals to track their health metrics, manage medical appointments, and engage with others in wellness activities.
1.Users can sign up with HealthTrack by providing their name, a unique Health ID (similar to an SSN), an email address, and a phone number. Only one phone can be recorded for each HealthTrack account, but an account can be associated with multiple email addresses. Email addresses and phone numbers should be verified before they can be used for critical functions (like receiving alerts). The system should be able to record both verified and non-verified contact information. The verification process itself is irrelevant for the design of the E/R schema.
2.Users can link multiple healthcare providers (e.g., doctors, specialists, therapists) with their account but should define one of them as their primary care physician. Providers are identified by a unique medical license number. Providers must be verified (e.g., confirmed against a registry) before they can be officially linked to a user’s profile. Users must also be able to unlink a provider. The system should be able to record both verified and non-verified providers. The verification process is irrelevant for the design of the E/R schema.
3.In the HealthTrack Network, two or more users can be associated as a "Family Group." This allows one user (e.g., a parent) to help manage the health profile of another (e.g., a child), with appropriate permissions.
4.There are two forms of actions that HealthTrack supports:
a. Book an Appointment with a provider.
b. Create a Wellness Challenge for other users.
5.Book an Appointment: This type of action can be done by specifying the provider's license number or verified email, the date and time, the type of consultation (e.g., In-Person, Virtual), and a memo (optional, for symptoms or questions). Every appointment transaction has a unique Id.
6.Create a Wellness Challenge: A user can request others to join a challenge by specifying their email addresses or phone numbers, the challenge goal (e.g., "Walk 100 miles in a month"), and start/end dates. The typical use case could be to "Start a Fitness Goal," where a challenge can be shared among friends and family. Every challenge has a unique Id. The system should specify which users are participating in the challenge and be able to track their progress.
7.An invitation to a challenge or to view shared data that is sent to an email address or phone number not associated with a HealthTrack account is considered an invitation to a new user. The recipient can accept within 15 days by signing up for HealthTrack. After 15 days, the invitation is cancelled. The same happens for invitations sent to an email address or phone number which is not verified. For every invitation, the date and time it was initiated and the date and time it was completed (or expired) should be recorded in the database.
8.Appointments can be cancelled up to 24 hours before their scheduled time. Cancelled appointments should be recorded in the database, as well as the reason they are cancelled (e.g., "Patient Rescheduled," "Provider Unavailable").
9.Users' health data and history should be organized in monthly summary reports. Also, search functionality should be provided (e.g., search for a provider, search for an appointment by date, search for total number of steps walked in a given month, etc.).
You can make further assumptions but: (a) they should not be in contradiction with the assumptions described above, and (b) they have to be clearly stated in your report.

Note that the above description contains both database requirements and functional requirements (actions related to the database). In designing your database schemas, you need to make sure that you have added the constructs that are needed to store the data required by the application. The functional requirements will be implemented at the application level.
